SELECT Statement

* one of the most common tasks is to query data from tables by using the SELECT statement

* it has many clauses that you can combine to for a powerful query

* SQL is case insensitive, use SQL keywords in upper case to make code more readable

basic format:

SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name

e.g. 
SELECT * FROM actor;
SELECT * FROM country;
SELECT first_name,last_name FROM actor;
SELECT actor_id FROM actor;

SELECT first_name,last_name,email 
FROM customer;
